      <h3>LSX - Action Planner App</h3>
      <p> A mobile-based app to help users create an action plan, to organise and facilitate change. This was designed
        with kids in mind as the main group that LSx is engaging with currently are school children</p>

      <p>Role: Scrum master</p>
      <br />
      <p>Retrospective:</p>
      <p>There is no perfect recipe when it comes to agile, figuring out a way that is best for your team and the given
        situation is the way to go. Don't make the process another job, make it work for you. Use stand-ups, backlogs
        and Github projects in a way that works for you, not against you.
        So when it comes to scrum 'Play your own game'. </p>

      <br />
      <p>Role:QA</p>
      <br />
      <p>Retrospective:</p>
      <p>Making clean code, writing code that is maintainable and easy to understand is not something that just happens,
        it needs love. Larger projects can become disjointed with different peoples styles. One key aide is agreeing on
        meaningful naming conventions. </p>
      <br />
      <p>Testing:</p>
      <p>Async testing in Jest was difficult; when introducing the database it changed our routes from rendering static
        pages to include async data. This broke all our route tests. We changed the route tests to include async build
        script before each test, and an "afterAll" script which would close the database connection before finishing the
        test run. We repeated this technique for our database tests.
